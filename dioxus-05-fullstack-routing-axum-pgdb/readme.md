## Dioxus 0.5 Fullstack with Routing, Axum, and Postgres

Just another sample project that showcases the usage of:

-   Dioxus Fullstack
-   SSR (server side routing)
    -   Navigation to a specific route (as in "deep links")
-   CSR (client side routing)
    -   URL reflects the path while navigating through pages
-   Using server functions that talk with Postgres
