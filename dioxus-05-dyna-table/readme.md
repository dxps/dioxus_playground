## A dynamic table example using Dioxus 0.5

A minimal example of using a dynamic "table" using Dioxus Fullstack ver. 0.5.<br/>
It's not actually a table, as the design uses `div`s with Flex model.

### Usage

1. In a terminal, run `./run_css.sh` to compile the CSS.
2. In another terminal, run `./run_dev` to run the example.

Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and play with it.
